# LocalWalletRelayUnity
Test for my wallet relay server for unity project.  
https://github.com/honehone12/local_wallet_relay  
With this relay server, desktop unity game can

1. get address from browser extension wallet.
1. pass function payload(just 4 properties of Json!!) to browser extension wallet.

Game can use address for view etc, while extension wallet keeps keys, sends transactions and manages accounts etc...  
User can use their wallet as always, and play game without creating new account or import account.
